# code-playground
A personal code playground to experiment with various ideas that really pique my interest. Sometimes it's just some boilerplate I never want to write again.

## Projects
- Cross-stitched [AprilTag trackers](https://github.com/ju1ce/April-Tag-VR-FullBody-Tracker): Leg tracker 1, part 3 completed. One more to test first leg.

- Hexgrid Concept: Still putting together bits and pieces, fleshing out ideas.

- uMinecraft: PaperMC plugin with server configuration that scales back player impacts to environment. Aiming for 8 players on 512 MB?
